                    <i>Week 8 Notes</i> - This page illustrates the notes I took while studying this week's materials. 
                    The notes also display photos from the reading with titled explanations. The goal was to make the 
                    webpage resemble a Cornell Notes sheet of paper. That layout was achieved for both mobile and 
                    desktop viewing.

                    <i>Team Activity</i> - This project was designed to handle API requests through FETCH methods. Using 
                    Promises or Async properties, we would use JSON to display external API data in a table.

                            the user to view.
