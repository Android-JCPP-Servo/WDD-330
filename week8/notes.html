            <ul class="lists">
                <li>Transforms and transitions are used to diversify the appearance of a webpage.</li>
                <li>
                    Many older web browsers use techniques that are similar to transforms and transitions, 
                    but the processes to create such details required a great deal of CSS and JavaScript.</li>
                </li>
                <li>
                    To simplify the process of creating moveable pictures and text, CSS3 was created and 
                    implemented transformations and transitions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If a developer wanted something to move, adjust positioning, or change color on a mouse-hover, 
                    the developer could use CSS3's new capabilities to achieve such goals.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Additionally, and based on personal experience, transforms and transitions can be used 
                    to fix an object's position on the screen. Instead of using "top:" (or "bottom:") and 
                    "left:" (or "right:"), a transform can be used to establish the exact same positioning 
                    (i.e. "transform: (50px, -50px);")
                </li>
                <li>
                    CSS3 transforms and transitions not only reduced the amount of code needed to adjust a 
                    picture, but also simplified the coordinate system and provided new special effects for developers.
                </li>

        </div>
        <div class="col-5">
            <p>Chapter 12</p>
            <ul class="lists">
                <li>Canvas is much similar to an artist's paint canvas, except in a digital manner.</li>
                <li>
                    When a developer uses Canvas, they are achieving a similar result to creating a shape 
                    in a separate platform, like Inkscape.
                </li>
                <li>
                    SVG images are files of code that can be used in multiple pages at once, much like a 
                    single JavaScript file called multiple times by different individual HTML files.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The developer has three ways of creating and displaying SVG images:
                    <ol class="lists" style="padding-top: 10px;">
                        <li>
                            Find a picture online, download it as an SVG, and then save the code in a file 
                            uploaded to a platform, such as Visual Studio Code.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Draw a picture in Inkscape, save it, download its SVG code, and then upload it to 
                            VS Code.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Using Sketch.app:
                            <ol class="lists" style="padding-top: 10px;">
                                <li>Upload photos or text to a document</li>
                                <li>Right-click on the image</li>
                                <li>Click "Copy SVG Code"</li>
                                <li>Paste the code to a file</li>
                                <li>Upload the file to VS Code</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Finally, Drag and Drop gives the user the ability to move objects with their cursor.</li>
                <li>
                    Users can either drag and drop files from their computer to their browser 
                    (i.e. "Upload Document(s) Here"), or objects from one part of the browser to another part 
                    (i.e. an interactive gaming website).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Several ways can be used to implement Drag and Drop:
                    <ol class="lists" style="padding-top: 10px;">
                        <li>"Set the draggable attribute on any HTML elements you'd like to be draggable.</li>
                        <li>"Add an event listener for the dragstart event on any draggable elements.</li>
                        <li>
                            Add an event listener for the dragover and drop events on any elements that you want 
                            to have accept dropped items.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col-4">
