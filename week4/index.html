            <ul>
                <li>
                    <i>Search Bar</i> - This project includes a search bar similar to Google, but not 
                    as complex. After the user enters a name, value, or other string into the search bar, 
                    an alert box will display what the user searched for, saying, "You searched for: 
                    (inserted value)".
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <i>I Need A Hero!</i> - This project allows the user to create a new hero. They can 
                    either use a superhero they know (i.e. Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, etc.) or use 
                    their own. After filling in all the hero's information, the user will see their hero 
                    information displayed as a JSON string array.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <i>Tic-Tac-Toe, Anyone?</i> - This project was designed in this week's Team Activity. 
                    The goal of the project was to create a table that could be clicked or touched, which 
                    would then display an 'X' or 'O' in a specific box chosen by the player. If it was 
                    Player 1's turn, an 'X' would be displayed; if it was Player 2's turn, an 'O' would be 
                    displayed. Additionally, the game could be reset with a Reset button, and a "Tie Game!" 
                    would be displayed if no lines were found or if 9 total taps occurred.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <i>Quiz Ninja</i> - This project is a compilation of all previous chapters. The game begins 
                    with a "Start Game" button, a timer for 20 seconds, and a score of 0. As the user answers 
                    questions correctly, their score is increased. If they answer incorrectly, the user gains no 
                    points. The timer continues ticking until the game ends or the user answers all questions.
