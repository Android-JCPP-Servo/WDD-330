                        <i>Weekly Readings</i> - I remember learning of Arrow Functions before, and have used them in assignments 
                        previous to this week, but I couldn't completely grasp the concept then. However, using Arrow 
                        Functions in the Team Activity help solidify them in my mind. I was able to see those functions in 
                        action, which helped me understand how they behave and perform within JavaScript.

                        <i>Quiz Ninja Project</i> - While implementing certain FOR loops within the project, I found a way to write 
                        Ternary Operator functions that nevr occurred to me before. I honestly cannot recall being taught this 
                        structure of code, but my compiler did not have an issue while writing it. To write a Ternary Operator 
                        function, it is constructed as follows:<br><br>
                        &emsp;&emsp;<i>(condition) ? (true result) : (false result);</i><br><br>
                        I had no idea that the results could be written in processes, such as:<br><br>
                        &emsp;&emsp;<i>(condition) ? (true process pt.1, true process pt.2, etc.) : (false process pt.1, false process pt.2, etc.);</i><br><br>
                        This was an amazing realization for me. I have begun using this pattern ever since my discovery of it.

                        <i>Team Activity</i> - Many different activities from past semesters came to mind during this exercise. 
                        For example, while designing the code for Core Requirement 3, my teammate and I realized we did something 
                        similar in a previous class. Not only did this realization simplify the code creation, but also helped us 
                        focus more on the succeeding Stretch Challenges.
