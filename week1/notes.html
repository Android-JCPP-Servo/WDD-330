        <p>
            I decided to work most on the Journal because I needed and wanted more practice with JSON
            parsing and stringifying. While most of the code was review to me, I was able to better
            grasp the concepts of parsing and stringifying. I now understand that parsing and stringifying
            is simply the computer's way of "kindergarten reading" - disecting a string one character
            at a time, then putting them back together into a string the user could understand. This new
            knowledge will hopefully give me better insight into backend development for another of my
            classes.
